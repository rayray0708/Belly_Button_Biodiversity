## Description 
In this challenge, I will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Instruction 
To see the JavaScript code for the interactive dashboard, please navigate to "Starter_Code" folder, select "static", "js" and open "app.js" with a code editor (e.g., VSCode).

To see the interactive dashboard, please download the "belly-button-challenge" directory to your local machine. Next, right-click on the "index.html" file and choose a browser to open the file with (e.g., Google Chrome). On your web browser, navigate to the drop-down menu and select an ID to view the corresponding bar and bubble charts; as well as the demographic information of this individual.
